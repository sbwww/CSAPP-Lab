some phases have multiple answers available, if so, they are listed in multiple lines

## phase_1

> Hmm...  Six phases must be more secure than one phase!

## phase_2

> The second phase is harder.  No one will ever figure out how to defuse this...

## phase_3

> I guess this is too easy so far.  Some more complex code will confuse people.

## phase_4

> Oh yeah?  Well, how good is your math?  Try on this saucy problem!

```plain

## phase_5

## phase_6

> This phase will never be used, since no one will get past the earlier ones.  But just in case, make this one extra hard.

```plain

## secret_phase

> Wow, they got it!  But isn't something... missing?  Perhaps something they overlooked?  Mua ha ha ha ha!

append the string "DrEvil" to the answer of phase_4, and you'll gain the access to the secret phase
